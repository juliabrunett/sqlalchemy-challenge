# sqlalchemy-challenge
*SQL Alchemy Homework:* This assignment used a SQLite database to extract data on weather measurements at weather stations in Hawaii. The data was first explored to find any interesting insights, using SQLAlchemy to query the database. Then, an API app was created to query the database and return JSON results when a user selects certain endpoint routes. 

***Resources Folder:***
- hawaii.sqlite
- hawaii_measurements.csv
- hawaii_stations.csv

**climate_analysis.ipynb:**
- This file contains the initial climate analysis and exploration of the SQLite database provided and graphs to better understand trends in the data.

**app.py:**
- This file contains code that runs an API app that returns JSON responses for different queries, depending on which endpoint the user selects.

**temp_analysis_bonus_1.ipynb:**
- This file contains a bonus section of the assignment, which looks at the average temperatures in Hawaii in June and December. The objective is to look at the statisical significance of the difference between temperatures in Hawaii in these two months.
